            When I was about 18, I did not want to be a woman. I was in a stage of transition to what was socially conceived as "adult life," and what followed included assuming a series of roles that didn’t interest me at all. Because of my life experiences and the family that I grew up in, to be a woman meant to be someone passive, ornamental, and sentenced by her appearance to be fragile. Therefore, I hated other women, and men who looked at me like a woman. My appearance changed, I gradually became more androgynous, and I even stopped menstruating for 3 years. The curious thing is that it was not a conscious process; it was something that my body manifested to protect itself. I was fighting femininity because femininity was something that others had decided was for me.

            I live in a Catholic country where abortion is illegal, sexuality is still handled with decorum and in vitro fertilization wasn’t approved in the legislation until about a year ago. What lies beneath these gears shows that your body and what it goes through does not belong to you. I want to create a character that lives in a body that’s not hers, therefore what happens to her body does not belong to her, nor does it concern her. I want to take that up to a limit where things cannot be fixed.

            I believe that this conflictive, passionate and greatly contradictory relationship that we live with "the other,” we live inside ourselves as well. I believe that everyone, regardless of gender, inhabits a foreign body.

            Medea is told through the eyes of its protagonist, who’s inspired by Euripides’ Medea: a character who represents the demystification of taboo images about femininity, Medea is a female character who, unlike the conventional representations of women in western narrative, is not a victim.
